# Quick and Clean Advanced Python
Covered topics

The main aim of this course is to introduce students to the so-called Zen of Python for quick and clean application of python in data science. The workshop is structured around  based on the industry way of classifying big data jobs: data analytics, data science, data engineering.  

Participants will have an opportunity to learn the following topics

General overview of computer choke points for various architectures together with a fast paced tutorial on advanced language concepts.
Scientific computing, statistics, visualization and data mining, via libraries such as numpy, pandas, statmodels and several other "science stack" libraries. 
Programming with focus on how to perform machine learning, deep learning, statistical learning and pattern recognition using python, via scikit-learn, tensorflow, pymc3 and other more exotic libraries.
Engineering the computing infrastructure and Python's role in it. How to run Python on clouds and GPU machines
Learning how Python can be used to organize your workflow with efficiency and reproducibility in mind.
Application to research themes where you will either pick one real ‘omics subject from a given task list or you will use Python in your project under our assistance. This is a great time to solidify your knowledge by applying it to your own research scope!


 Learning outcomes

At the end of the course the course participants will have achieved following objectives

General knowledge about computational workflow using python
Have knowledge about computer architecture and use of python for efficient computing
Knowledge about python libraries for machine learning, deep learning and statistical learning and their applications
Ability to apply advanced python libraries in own research field
